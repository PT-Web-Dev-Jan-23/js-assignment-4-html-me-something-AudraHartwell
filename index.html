            <h2> Camp Counselor in Minnesota Summer 2014</h2>
            <a name = "campCounselor"></a>
            <p>After my freshman year of college, I decided that I wanted a non-traditional summer camp job. I wanted to
               go
               somewhere new and do something fun. I used a site called <a href="www.coolworks.com"></a> to find different
               opportunities. I
               ended up getting a job at Camp Lake Hubert for girls in Northern Minnesota. I knew very little about the
               camp before I packed a bag and headed north to spend 3 months of my life. Luckily it ended up being one
               of
               the best times of my life. I even headed back up for summer number two the next summer. </p>

            <h2> Being an Au Pair in Australia Summer 2016</h2>
            <p> After my second summer at camp, I decided I needed even MORE adventure for my summers. I decided I
               wanted to visit my Autralia friends from that summer. I found a website <a href=aupairworld.com></a>
               that matches families with potential au pairs. For reference, an au pair is basically a
               live in nanny from a different county. You get paid a small stipend plus room and board to nanny the
               children, and you get to experience a new country. I found a family, and once again packed my bags and
               boarded a flight to Brisbane, Australia where I would meet complete strangers and live with them for the
               next 3 months. I loved my time in Australia. This was my first international flight experience, and I
               learned a lot of travel tips along the way! Overall it was a great experience, and I returned to college
               a more worldly individual. 10/10 would recommend.

            <h2> Roadtrip across the US May 2017</h2>
            <p> After I graduated college, I had exactly 2 weeks until I had to be back in Kirksville, MO to start my
               masters program. My friend and I had decided we wanted to take a cross-country road trip. We made a list
               of the places we wanted to go. Mine consisted of Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Las
               Vegas, and the Grand Canyon. Alternatively, her's consisted of In and out. We packed our bags and headed
               west, much like Lewis and Clark had centuries before us. We had no hotel reservations and no route. From
               the front passaenger seat, I used my Mom's paper atlas to map our daily drives, and hotels.com to book
               our hotels each night. Besides a snow storm in Colorado that altered the route, the road trip went
               surprisingly smooth and we returned seasoned travelers!

            <h2> Ragnar Relay in Mount Rainier</h2>
            <p> First let me introduce you to what is a "Ragnar Relay." As the name implies, a Ragnar relay is a relay
               race that lasts roughly 24-30 hours and covers 100-200ish miles. They have two types: road and trail.
               Basically the trail races consists of 3 loops, that the entirity of your 8 man team runs continuously for
               roughly 26 hours. This particular race happened to be located in the beautiful Mount Rainier. However, in
               the summer of 2018 I had no idea what a Ragnar relay was. I had simply received a text message "do you
               want to run a mountain race with me in August in Washinton?" To which I responded "sure." I really didn't
               think much of the race until about a week before I was set to leave. I found out I needed a headlamp
               (because you run the trails at night) and went ahead and picked up some trail shoes. Then I flew out to
               Seattle to meet my friend and 7 strangers. As a nice warm-up, my friend and I hiked 11 miles in the
               mountains the day before the race. Well come race day, the only thing I brough to eat was a family size
               box of cheez its. Luckily there was a race provided dinner. My friend neglected to set up a tent, so we
               ended up sleeping in his car about a mile from the race site. But...overall the 3 day excursion was
               incredibly fun and so so so beautiful! I was definitely a lot more prepared for my second Ragnar too!

            <h2>#Vanlife in Utah March 2022</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               The pandemic had finally come to an end, and my friend and I decided we wanted to explore Utah. But, we
               did not want to travel the conventional path! We decided that we could just rent a van and travel the
               entirity of the state. With little research conducted, we packed our bags and flew the Phoenix. We picked
               up our van and headed out for adventure! The first night we encountered our first trial which was the
               perplexing issue of timezones inside and outside of Arizona. After pulling over and sleeping on the side
               of the road somewhere in Utah, we awoke to two different times on our phone and no idea what "time" it
               actually was. As the week went on, we became #vanlife experts. We slept in walmart parking lots, random
               highways, a campsite, and a lovely hotel in Salt Lake City. We visited 3 national parks, horsehoe bend,
               the salt flats, and a whole lot of Red Rocks. We learned to use a coleman grill and go days without
               showering. One week later, we returned to Phoenix tired, dirty, and with a hefty overcharge for driving
               way too many miles...totally worth it.
